      "Democracy is a system of government where the supreme power is vested in the people. The word 'democracy' comes from two Greek words: 'demos' meaning 'people', and 'kratos' meaning 'rule'. So, democracy literally means 'rule by the people'.",
      "In a democracy, citizens exercise their power either directly or through elected representatives. In a direct democracy, all citizens meet to decide on policies. This is rare today. Most modern democracies are representative democracies.",
      "In a representative democracy, citizens elect officials to make political decisions, formulate laws, and run programs on their behalf. Free and fair elections are a cornerstone of this system, allowing people to choose their leaders and hold them accountable.",
      "Besides elections, key features of a democracy include protecting basic human rights, such as freedom of speech and religion. It also requires the rule of law, meaning that everyone, including the government, is subject to the law.",
      "While no system is perfect, democracy is designed to prevent the abuse of power and to ensure that the government serves the interests of the people. It is a system built on the principles of equality, freedom, and representation."

      "Socrates is one of the most famous figures in history, but he left no writings of his own. What we know of him comes primarily from the works of his student, Plato. Socrates was a classical Greek philosopher credited as one of the founders of Western philosophy.",
      "He is best known for the 'Socratic method'. This is a form of cooperative argumentative dialogue between individuals, based on asking and answering questions to stimulate critical thinking and to draw out ideas and underlying presumptions.",
      "Socrates believed that the unexamined life is not worth living. He would often wander the streets of Athens, engaging citizens in conversations about concepts like justice, virtue, and knowledge. He claimed that his wisdom was in knowing that he knew nothing.",
      "This constant questioning, however, made powerful people in Athens uncomfortable. They accused him of corrupting the youth and not believing in the city's gods. He was put on trial, found guilty, and sentenced to death.",
      "Despite his tragic end, Socrates's influence is immeasurable. His emphasis on reason, self-examination, and the relentless pursuit of truth has shaped the course of Western thought for over two millennia. He taught us not what to think, but how to think."
